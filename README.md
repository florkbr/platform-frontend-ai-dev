# Dev Bot (Rehor)

An autonomous developer agent that picks groomed Jira tickets, implements them, opens PRs, and maintains them through review — all without human intervention. It runs in a polling loop using the Claude Agent SDK (Python) and integrates with Jira, GitHub/GitLab, and a persistent memory system.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the bot, make sure you have the following installed:

| Dependency | Purpose | Install |
|------------|---------|---------|
| [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) | Agent runtime (bundled with the SDK) | `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` |
| [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) | Python package manager | `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh \| sh` |
| [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) + Docker Compose | Memory server, target repo dev environments | Install Docker Desktop |
| [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) + npm | TypeScript LSP server | `brew install node` or via nvm |
| [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) | JSON processing | `brew install jq` |
| [gh](https://cli.github.com/) | GitHub CLI | `brew install gh` then `gh auth login` (use SSH protocol) |
| [glab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cli) | GitLab CLI (only for GitLab repos) | `brew install glab` then `glab auth login` (use SSH protocol) |
| SSH keys | Git access to target repos | Must be configured for GitHub and/or GitLab |

The bot also uses the [mcp-atlassian](https://github.com/sooperset/mcp-atlassian) MCP server for Jira integration (configured in `.mcp.json`).

### Authentication

The bot needs credentials for several services. Set these in `.env` (copy from `.env.example` or create manually):

```bash
# Jira — required
# Generate your API token at: https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens
JIRA_URL=https://your-instance.atlassian.net
JIRA_USERNAME=your-email@company.com
JIRA_API_TOKEN=your-jira-api-token

# Claude — GCP Vertex AI (service account)
# Follow the RH internal guide to set up Vertex AI access
# and generate a service account key file (sa-key.json).

# GitHub — bot PAT for gh CLI
GH_TOKEN=ghp_...

# GitLab — personal PAT for glab CLI (api + write_repository scopes)
GITLAB_TOKEN=glpat-...
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone this repo
git clone <repo-url> dev-bot && cd dev-bot

# 2. Install Python dependencies and set up LSP + memory server
make init

# 3. Create your .env file with credentials (see Authentication above)
cp .env.example .env  # then edit with your values

# 4. Run the bot for a specific team label
make run LABEL=hcc-ai-framework
```

The bot will start polling for Jira tickets with the `hcc-ai-framework` label. It logs to stdout and `bot.log`.

### Available make targets

```
make init              # Full setup: install deps, LSP, start memory server
make run               # Run the bot on host (LABEL=hcc-ai-framework by default)
make run-rbac          # Run the bot with platform-accessmanagement label
make stop              # Stop a running bot (release lock)
make logs              # Tail bot log
make memory-server     # Start memory server + postgres (standalone)
make memory-server-stop # Stop standalone memory server
make docker-up         # Start full stack in Docker (postgres + memory server + bot)
make docker-down       # Stop full stack
make dashboard         # Build the dashboard UI
make costs             # Show all cost data
make costs-today       # Show today's costs
make costs-week        # Show this week's costs
make seed-costs        # Import costs.jsonl into the database
make help              # Show all available commands
```

You can also run the bot directly: `uv run dev-bot --label <your-label>`

## How it works

The bot operates in **cycles**. Each cycle, it evaluates all of its tracked work and acts on exactly one item, following a strict priority order:

### Priority 0: Respond to feedback and finish incomplete work

The bot starts every cycle by checking its tracked tasks for anything that needs immediate attention:

1. **New feedback** — PR review comments, Jira comments, failing CI, or merge conflicts since the bot last addressed a task. Human feedback is always the highest priority.
2. **Interrupted work** — if the bot ran out of turns mid-implementation (branch created but no PR yet), it picks up where it left off using progress metadata.
3. **Unfinished investigations** — investigation tickets where the analysis hasn't been posted to Jira yet.

### Priority 1: Maintain existing PRs

For each open PR, the bot checks (in order): CI failures, merge conflicts, review feedback, Jira comments, and merged PRs. When a PR merges, it closes the task, transitions the Jira ticket to Done, and saves what it learned to memory.

### Priority 1.5: Check assigned Jira tickets

Scans tickets assigned to the bot for merged PRs it hasn't noticed or new Jira comments.

### Priority 2: Pick new work

Only when everything is clean — no pending feedback, no interrupted work, all PRs green — the bot looks for new tickets. It searches memory for relevant past learnings, claims the ticket, creates a branch, implements, tests, and opens a PR.

## Preparing tickets for the bot

Tickets must be explicitly groomed. The bot never picks random backlog items.

### Required labels

- **Primary label** (e.g. `hcc-ai-framework`, `hcc-ai-platform-accessmanagement`) — marks the ticket as bot-eligible for a specific team. The bot only picks up tickets with its configured label.
- **`repo:<name>`** — identifies the target repo (must match a key in `project-repos.json`). A ticket can have multiple `repo:` labels for cross-repo work.

### Optional labels

- `needs-investigation` — bot investigates and reports findings instead of implementing
- `platform-experience-ui` — routes the ticket to the UI sprint (scrum boards only)

### Interactive grooming

There's a prompt that walks you through preparing a ticket:

```bash
claude --prompt-file prompts/groom.md
```

It helps identify repos, suggests labels, and produces a ready-to-create ticket with acceptance criteria.

### What makes a good bot ticket

- **Clear problem statement** — current vs expected behavior
- **Specific files or components** if known (saves the bot time)
- **URL paths** where the issue is visible
- **Acceptance criteria** as a concrete checklist
- **Scoped to a single PR** — if it's too big, split it

The bot is a good developer but has zero tribal knowledge. Don't assume it knows your team's history.

## Adding a new repo

All repos use forks by default. The bot pushes to the fork and opens PRs/MRs targeting the upstream repo.

1. Fork the repo under the bot's account (e.g. `platex-rehor-bot`):
   ```bash
   gh repo fork RedHatInsights/my-repo --clone=false
   ```
2. Add to `project-repos.json`:
   ```json
   "my-repo": {
     "url": "git@github.com:platex-rehor-bot/my-repo.git",
     "upstream": "git@github.com:RedHatInsights/my-repo.git"
   }
   ```
   For GitLab repos, add `"host": "gitlab"`.
3. Add a `repo:my-repo` label to the Jira ticket.

The bot clones repos automatically when it picks up a ticket. It fetches from `upstream`, creates branches based on the latest upstream code, pushes to `origin` (the fork), and opens PRs/MRs targeting the upstream repo.

### Persona selection

Personas are NOT hardcoded to repos. The bot dynamically selects the best-fit persona(s) based on the ticket description and the repo's tech stack (e.g. `package.json` → `frontend`, `go.mod` → `backend`/`operator`, Dockerfile-only → `tooling`, config repo → `config`). For CVE tickets, the `cve` persona layers on top of the base persona.

## Running the services

### Option A: Bot on host, memory server in Docker (recommended)

The recommended setup for development. The bot runs directly on your machine while the memory server runs in Docker.

#### 1. Configure `.env`

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your credentials. All identity and auth settings are driven by `.env` — at startup, `run.py` reads these and auto-configures git and SSH.

**Git identity** — set `GIT_AUTHOR_NAME`, `GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL`, `GIT_COMMITTER_NAME`, `GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL` to commit as the bot account. If unset, your local git config is used.

**GPG signing** — import the bot's GPG key (`gpg --import <key-file>`), then set `GPG_SIGNING_KEY` to the key ID. If unset, commits are not signed. In Docker, GPG keys are imported automatically in the proxy container from `GPG_PRIVATE_KEY_B64`.

**CLI auth** — set `GH_TOKEN` and/or `GITLAB_TOKEN`, or log in manually:
```bash
gh auth login                                       # GitHub
glab auth login --hostname gitlab.cee.redhat.com    # GitLab
```

> **Note**: In Docker, CLI credentials (`GH_TOKEN`, `GITLAB_TOKEN`, `GPG_PRIVATE_KEY_B64`) are injected into the **proxy container**, not the bot. The bot uses thin client shims that forward CLI commands to the proxy over gRPC. See [Architecture](#architecture-credential-isolation).

#### 2. Start the services

```bash
# Start memory server + postgres
make memory-server

# Run bot on host (uses localhost:8080 for memory server)
make run LABEL=hcc-ai-framework
```

### Option B: Full stack in Docker

For production-like deployments or CI — everything runs in containers with credential isolation (see [Architecture](#architecture-credential-isolation)):

```bash
# Set secrets (or add to .env — see SOP.md for details)
# CLI tokens + GPG key → proxy container (credential isolation)
export GH_TOKEN=<your-pat>
export GITLAB_TOKEN=<your-gitlab-pat>
export GPG_PRIVATE_KEY_B64=$(base64 -i .ssh/gpg-private.asc)

# SA key + Jira token → bot container (not yet isolated)
export GOOGLE_SA_KEY_B64=$(base64 -i sa-key.json)

# Start everything
make docker-up

# Override the bot label
BOT_LABEL=hcc-ai-platform-accessmanagement make docker-up

# Stop
make docker-down
```

### Memory server + dashboard

The memory server runs as Docker containers (PostgreSQL with pgvector + Python app). `make init` starts it automatically.

```bash
make memory-server              # Start
make memory-server-stop         # Stop
```

Dashboard at **http://localhost:8080** — tasks, memories, semantic search, 3D embedding map. Live WebSocket updates.

### Browser for visual verification

For UI changes, the bot uses chrome-devtools MCP to take screenshots. Start a Chrome/Chromium instance with remote debugging:

```bash
./start-chromium.sh
```

This launches Chrome on port 9222 with a separate profile. Edit the script to use `chromium` if that's what you have.

### 3. Configuration

`config.json` controls the bot's behavior:

```json
{
  "claude": {
    "maxTurns": 100,
    "model": "claude-opus-4-6"
  },
  "polling": {
    "intervalSeconds": 300,
    "idleIntervalSeconds": 3600
  }
}
```

MCP servers are configured in `.mcp.json` (project-level) and `personas/*/mcp.json` (per-persona tools).

## Personas

Each repo has one or more personas that provide domain-specific guidelines. Personas live in `personas/<type>/prompt.md`:

| Persona | Scope |
|---------|-------|
| `frontend` | React/TypeScript/PatternFly repos. Visual verification, `npm run lint/test`. |
| `backend` | Go and Node.js backend services. |
| `rbac` | Django/DRF RBAC service (insights-rbac). Docker Compose dev env, `make unittest-fast`. |
| `operator` | Kubernetes operators (Go). |
| `config` | Config repos (app-interface). Read-only or GitLab MR workflow. |
| `cve` | CVE remediation — dependency upgrades, base image updates, security scanning. |
| `tooling` | Build/dev infrastructure — Dockerfiles, shell scripts, proxy configs. |

## Memory system

The bot has persistent memory via MCP:

- **Task tracking** — structured records of active work with status, PR links, and progress metadata. Hard cap of 10 concurrent active tasks. When interrupted mid-cycle, the bot saves progress (`last_step`, `next_step`, `files_changed`) so the next cycle resumes seamlessly.
- **RAG memory** — vector-searchable knowledge base of learnings from completed tickets, PR review feedback, and codebase patterns. The bot searches this before starting any new ticket, so it improves over time.

### Exporting and importing memory

The bot's memory (tasks, learnings, cost data) can be exported and shared so others can bootstrap from existing knowledge.

```bash
# Export current memory to a SQL dump
make memory-dump        # → data/memory-dump.sql

# Import on another machine (additive — skips duplicates)
make memory-import      # ← data/memory-dump.sql

# Full reset — wipe all data and reimport from dump
make memory-reset
```

The dump file (`data/memory-dump.sql`) is gitignored. Store it in shared storage (e.g. Google Drive) and distribute to team members setting up new instances.

## Cost tracking

Each cycle records its cost to `costs.jsonl` and the memory server database.

```bash
make costs           # All recorded cycles
make costs-today     # Today only
make costs-week      # Last 7 days
./costs.sh 2026-03-31   # Specific date
./costs.sh backfill     # Import from bot.log
```

The dashboard at http://localhost:8080 also shows cost charts with per-cycle breakdowns by work type.

## Architecture: Credential Isolation

The bot uses a **defense-in-depth** model to prevent credential leakage. Secrets never enter the bot container — all credential-bearing operations are proxied through a separate **proxy container**.

```
Bot Container                          Proxy Container
+----------------------------+         +----------------------------+
| Claude Agent SDK           |         | Squid (port 3128)          |
|                            |         |   domain allowlist         |
| thin client (Go binary)   |         | executor-server (gRPC 9090)|
|   /usr/local/bin/gh  ------+--TCP--->|   policy allowlist check   |
|   /usr/local/bin/glab -----+--TCP--->|   exec gh-real / glab-real |
|   /usr/local/bin/gpg ------+--TCP--->|   exec gpg (signing)       |
|                            |         |   tokens in config files   |
| git push                   |         |                            |
|   credential helper -------+--TCP--->|   gh auth git-credential   |
+----------------------------+         +----------------------------+
```

### How it works

- **CLI tools** (`gh`, `glab`, `gpg`) in the bot container are **thin client shims** — a single Go binary (hardlinked as `gh`, `glab`, `gpg`) that detects the tool name from `argv[0]` and forwards commands over gRPC to the proxy's executor server.
- The **executor server** validates commands against a built-in **policy allowlist** (e.g. `gh pr create` is allowed, `gh auth token` is blocked), then executes the real CLI binary with full credentials.
- **Git credential helpers** are configured globally so `git push` transparently authenticates via the thin client → proxy path.
- **GPG commit signing** works the same way — git invokes `gpg --sign` which routes through the thin client to the proxy's GPG keyring.
- **HTTP/HTTPS traffic** is routed through Squid with a domain allowlist — the bot container has no direct internet access.
- **Bash hooks** (`.claude/hooks/validate-bash.sh`) block dangerous commands (curl, eval, credential reads) as an additional defense layer.

### What lives where

| Component | Bot Container | Proxy Container |
|-----------|:---:|:---:|
| GH_TOKEN / GITLAB_TOKEN | - | yes |
| GPG private key | - | yes |
| gh / glab CLIs (real) | - | yes |
| gh / glab / gpg (thin client) | yes | - |
| Squid proxy | - | yes |
| Agent SDK + bot code | yes | - |
| Google SA key | yes* | - |
| Jira API token | yes* | - |

\* SA key and Jira token still reside in the bot container today. Planned isolation: [RHCLOUD-47293](https://redhat.atlassian.net/browse/RHCLOUD-47293) (Vertex AI proxy) and [RHCLOUD-47287](https://redhat.atlassian.net/browse/RHCLOUD-47287) (MCP air-lock for Jira).

### Deployment

- **OpenShift**: Bot and proxy run as separate pods connected via ClusterIP Service. A `NetworkPolicy` restricts bot egress to the proxy and memory-server pods only.
- **Docker Compose**: Bot and proxy run as separate containers on an internal network. A shared tmpfs volume provides a Unix Domain Socket for the executor, and docker-compose networking handles TCP communication. Only the proxy container is on the external network.
